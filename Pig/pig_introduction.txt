Apache PIG
History
- it was developed by Yahoo in 2006
- Pig was open-sourced by Apache in 2007
- In 2008 Apache Pig was released for first time
- Hadoop Pig graduated as an Apache top-level project in 2010

What is PIG ?
- it's an abstraction over MapReduce
- pig provides a high-level language known as Pig Latin
- Apache Pig has a component known as Pig Engine, which accepts Pig Latin Scripts as input and converts them into MapReduce Jobs

Why PIG ?
- Pig Latin is SQL-Like Language
- it supports basic data operations like joins, order, group by, filters, etc. it also provides nested data types like tuples, bags, maps.

Features of PIG
- lot of operators
- handles all kind of data
- UDF - User Defined Functions

Architecture of PIG
Parser
  - Pig Scripts are handled by the Parser. Parser's output will be a DAG (Directed acycling graph).
  - logical operators of the script are represented as nodes and the data flows are represented as edges.

Optimizer
- DAG is passed to the logical optimizer

Compiler
- it compiles the optimized logical plan into a seris of MapReduce jobs

Execution Engine
- MapReduce jobs are submitted to Hadoop in sorted order.
