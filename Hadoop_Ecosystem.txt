Hadoop - Java + Python
Installation - Windows + Linux
-------------------------------

Hadoop Ecosystem
- platform or suite which provides various services to solve big data problems
- it includes Apache projects

4 major elements of Hadoop
- HDFS
- YARN
- MapReduce
- Hadoop Common
--------------------------------------

HDFS
NameNode - master - file type, memory, name (meta data)
DataNode - slave - actual data

HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System
YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator
MapReduce - Programming Based Data Processing
PIG/HIVE - Query Based Processing of data services
HBase - NoSQL Database
Spark - In-Memory Data processing
Zookeeper - Managing Cluster
Oozie - Job Scheduling
Mahout/Spark MLLib - Machine Learning algorithms libraries
Solar/Lucene - Searching and Indexing
Drill - SQL on Hadoop
Flume/Sqoop - Data Integration services
HCatalog - Table and storage management layer for hadoop
Avro - Data Serialization System
Thrift - scalable cross-language services development


Apache PIG
- PIG Latin - Language (Structure is like SQL)
- PIG Runtime - execution environment (Just Like JVM)
- 10 line = 150 - 200 lines of MR Java Code
- Developer by Yahoo

Apache HIVE
- Developed by Facebook
- HIVE + SQL = HQL (Hive Query Language)
- Hive Command Line and JDBC/ODBC Driver

Apache HBase
- No SQL Database
- Build upon Google's BigTable

Apache Spark
- Written in Scala
- it executes in-memory computations to increase speed of data processing over map-reduce
- it is 100x faster than hadoop

Apache Mahout
- Used for Machine Learning
- Recommendation Systems

Apache Zookeeper
- Coordinator of jobs running in hadoop

Apache OOZIE
- For apache jobs, Oozie has been just like a scheduler
- Oozie workflow and Oozie Coordinator

Apache Flume
- helps in integration of unstructured and semi-structured data into HDFS

Apache Sqoop
- import/export structured data

Apache SOLR & LUCENE
- services used for searching & indexing
- it is based on java, also helps in spell checks
